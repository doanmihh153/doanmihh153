# 👋 Hello, I'm Minh!

🧑‍💻 I majored in **Software Engineer**, but along the way, I lost my focus and spent three years exploring **Graphic Design**.  
✨ Fortunately, I rediscovered my true passion for coding and decided to come back stronger and more committed than ever!

🚀 Right now, I'm in the process of **rebuilding** my skills and working on new projects.  
💬 Things might look a little rough here for now, but I'm excited to learn, grow, and share my journey with everyone!

### 📚 What I'm focusing on:
- Improving my coding skills from the ground up
- Building real-world projects
- Learning modern development tools and technologies

### 🌱 A few things about me:
