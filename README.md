# 👋 Hello, I'm Minh!

🧑‍🎓 I'm a final-year student majoring in **Software Engineering** at HUTECH University.  
🎨 During my academic journey, I spent nearly 3 years exploring the world of **Graphic Design**, stepping away from my core field for a while.

✨ But deep down, I've always been passionate about **technology and coding** — and recently, I’ve decided to return to this path with full commitment.  
Although I started taking coding seriously only about **6 months ago**, I move forward every day with purpose and determination.

🚀 Right now, I’m focusing on **rebuilding my skills** from the ground up and developing real-world projects to strengthen my foundation.  
💬 Things might still look a bit rough, but I’m excited to **learn, grow**, and **share my journey** with everyone here.

📈 I may have started later than others,  
but I’ll never stop **learning**, exploring **new languages**, mastering **new frameworks**,  
and continuously pushing myself to grow — not just for myself, but also to contribute to the teams, companies, and communities I’ll work with in the future.
